# ACE Short Course

This is a simple presentation that I did when I instructed on AI and ML on the 10th-13th of Dec 2019

This was a short course and the material is more introductory because one can't teach this in a short while however I covered some key concepts.

If you are interested to have a look and learn simply clone the repository and get started with in your jupyter notebooks.
